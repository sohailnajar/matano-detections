description: 'Detects the deletion of an AWS SAML provider, potentially indicating
  malicious intent to disrupt administrative or security team access.

  An attacker can remove the SAML provider for the information security team or a
  team of system administrators, to make it difficult for them to work and investigate
  at the time of the attack and after it.
