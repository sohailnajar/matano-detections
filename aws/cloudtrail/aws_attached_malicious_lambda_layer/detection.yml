description: 'Detects when an user attached a Lambda layer to an existing function
  to override a library that is in use by the function, where their malicious code
  could utilize the function''s IAM role for AWS API calls.

  This would give an adversary access to the privileges associated with the Lambda
  service role that is attached to that function.
