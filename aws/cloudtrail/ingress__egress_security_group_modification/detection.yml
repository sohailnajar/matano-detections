description: 'Detects when an account makes changes to the ingress or egress rules
  of a security group.

  This can indicate that an attacker is attempting to open up new attack vectors in
  the account, that they are trying to exfiltrate data over the network, or that they
  are trying to allow machines in that VPC/Subnet to contact a C&C server.
